# After a restart of Spyder both packets are listed in pip, and you can access the FTDI devices:

# Package                            Version  
# ---------------------------------- ---------
# ...
# ftd2xx                             1.1.2    
# ... 
# pypiwin32                          223      
# ...
# With another Python installation, pypiwin32 was automatically replaced/superseded by pywin32.

# To connect ftd3xxx devices:
# See https://ftdichip.com/software-examples/ft600-601-software-examples/
# Download https://ftdichip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D3XXPython_Release1.0.zip
# Unpack it. In open Anaconda3 (64-bit), Anaconda Powershell Prompt (Anaconda3), navigate
# by "cd D3XXPython_Release1.0" etc and enter: python setup.py install
# From https://ftdichip.com/software-examples/ft600-601-software-examples/ download D3XX.
# After unpacking, copy FTD3XX.dll into the directory C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3.
# Now you are read to use ftd3xx.

# For the package Python_USB you need Matlab Runtime R2021a (9.10). Download and install it,
# starting from https://de.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

# How to work without Matlab: It is possible to run Matlab .m files on Octave.
# Octave can be run from Python, using oct2py. 
# In addition, a Python package Python_USB has been compiled from the underlying Matlab .m files.
# initepc, initeps, initpm, initlu are run to connect EPC1000, EPS1000, PM1000, LU1000. 
# readepc, readeps, readpm, readlu read from these devices. 
# writeepc, writeeps, writepm, writelu write into these devices. 
# closeepc, closeeps, closepm, closelu write into these devices. 
# Without argument, initepc, initeps, initpm, initlu load
# LastDevEPC.mat, LastDevEPS.mat, LastDevPM.mat, LastDevLU.mat,
# where the last connected devices are stored. The file format is Matlab .mat with
# option "-v6", which is compatible with Octave. 
# Initially and when devices are changed these files must be created.
# We create LastDevEPC.mat, LastDevEPS.mat, LastDevPM.mat, LastDevLU.mat
# by running initepc(0), initeps(0), initpm(0), initlu(0) under oct2py. 
# Then closeepc, closeeps, closepm, closelu are run under oct2py.
# This frees EPC1000, EPS1000, PM1000, LU1000 for subsequent connection under my_Novoptel.
# Before this connection, device data is loaded from the 4 files, under oct2py.
# To call initepc, initeps, initpm, initlu under Python, the type argument must be 2
# and a second argument is needed, the device descritptor string.
